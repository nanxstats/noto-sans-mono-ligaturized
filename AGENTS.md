# Agent guidelines

- Respect existing changes; never reset or revert unless explicitly told.
- Prefer fast read/search tools (`rg`, `rg --files`); avoid destructive commands.
- Use `apply_patch` for edits; keep ASCII; add comments only when clarifying non-obvious logic.
- Follow sandbox/approval rules; request escalation when network or restricted paths are required.
- No heavy formatting in replies; reference files with clickable code paths (e.g., `fonts/LigaNotoSansMono-Regular.otf`).
- When automating, include validation or assertions where practical; summarize key outcomes succinctly.
